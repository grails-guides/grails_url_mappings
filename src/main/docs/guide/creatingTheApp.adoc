Please choose from the following options to create your project:

=== 1. Create a new Application via the Grails CLI

If you have Grails (>= 3.3.0) installed, you can create your application on the command line:

[source,bash]
----
~ grails create-app agenda
----

=== 2. Create a new Application via the Application Forge

You can download your project from http://start.grails.org, either by using the online wizard, or the following `curl` command:

[source,bash]
----
~ curl -O start.grails.org/agenda.zip -d version=3.3.2
----

=== 3. Use the Initial Project from the Guide Repo

Within the guide directory, copy the `initial` project to a directory of your choice, rename it (e.g., `agenda`), and follow along with the guide from within that project.
