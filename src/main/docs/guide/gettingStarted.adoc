Now that we have a Grails project up and running, it's time to start laying out the API. Whether you're building a traditional page-based application, a Single-Page App, or a microservice, having a logical, extendable API is a very important part of application design. Grails offers powerful support for building APIs with http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/theWebLayer.html#urlmappings[*URL Mappings*].

The sample application we are going to build will be a conference scheduling app, called `agenda`. We will have a simple domain model consisting of Speakers, Talks, an Agenda (which ties together speakers and talks), and a Conference (which has an agenda). We won't be creating the domain model in this guide, but we'll create the web layer that will sit above it for now.
