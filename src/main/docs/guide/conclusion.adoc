At this point you should be comfortable with the concept of URL mappings, and you have a good handle on the most important features. You can learn much more about the capabilities of URL mappings from the http://docs.grails.org/3.3.2/guide/single.html#urlmappings[Grails Documentation], including *namespaces*, RESTful *resource* mappings, *constraints*, and *wildcards*.   Over the next few days we'll see a few of these features in action as we build out our *agenda* application.

Congratulations! See you again for *Day 3: Controllers & Testing*!
